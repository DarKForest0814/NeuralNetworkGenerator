# Neural Network Generator C++
A Neural Network Generator written in C ++, capable of generating any given amount of neurons in any given amount of layers.

The code is written in an object oriented manner, and is focused on generating a Neural Network which is capable of feedforward ( backpropagation will be added at a later point ).
